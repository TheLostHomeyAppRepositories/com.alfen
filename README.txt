This app adds support for the Alfen charger (single connection) and will make sure the charger is shown as chargepoint in Homey Energy. The apps doesn't support any actions to update settings in the Alfen chargestation.

Please note: for this app to work your Homey and the Charger must be connected to the same SUBNET. So if you have different subnets within your household, make sure the charger and your Homey are in the same. Otherwise you cannot login, this is a limitation/security measure on Alfen side.
